# FaceDetection
The idea of machine learning is applied in this Android app. It utilises Firebase as a database, which is connected by a face detection machine learning idea. The app's UI includes an image view and an open camera button[Interface]. When the button is pressed, the camera opens to take the photo [Attempt]; once the photo is taken, a choice to keep or trash it is presented [Capture]; and finally, the result is displayed (result).
